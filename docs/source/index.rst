Common Reasons Why Your Canon Printer Won’t Connect to WiFi
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Incorrect WiFi Password**  

   One of the most common reasons is entering the wrong network password. Even a single incorrect character can prevent your printer from connecting.

2. **Weak or Unstable WiFi Signal**  

   If the printer is too far from the router or there are many obstacles in between, the signal might be too weak for a stable connection.

3. **Outdated Printer Firmware**  

   Old firmware may lack compatibility with updated network protocols, causing connection issues.

4. **Router Configuration Problems**  

   Sometimes, the problem is with the router itself—such as restricted access, firewall settings, or a disabled WPS function.

5. **Incorrect Network Selection**  

   If the printer tries to connect to the wrong WiFi network or an unavailable one, it won’t establish a connection.

6. **Disabled Wireless Feature on Printer**  

   Some users accidentally turn off the wireless function on their Canon printers, which blocks any attempts to connect to WiFi.

7. **Driver or Software Issues**  

   Missing or outdated printer drivers on your computer can prevent the Canon printer from completing the connection process.

Step-by-Step Solutions to Fix Canon Printer WiFi Connection
------------------------------------------------------------

1. **Restart Your Devices**  

   Power off your printer and router. Wait for 30 seconds, then power them back on. This simple reset can clear temporary network glitches.

2. **Verify WiFi Credentials**  

   Double-check your SSID and WiFi password. Make sure there are no typos and that you're selecting the correct network on the printer.

3. **Move the Printer Closer to the Router**  

   To ensure strong signal strength, place your printer within 5–10 feet of the router, free from large metal objects or thick walls.

4. **Use the Canon Wireless Setup**  

   Access the printer’s settings and choose "Wireless LAN setup." Follow the prompts to connect your printer to the desired WiFi network.

5. **Try WPS Method (If Supported)**  

   If your router and printer both support WPS, press the WPS button on the router, then the same on the printer to automatically connect them.

6. **Update Printer Firmware**  

   Visit the official Canon support website, search your printer model, and download any available firmware updates.

7. **Reinstall or Update Printer Drivers**  

   Outdated or corrupted drivers can block network communication. Install the latest version of your printer driver from Canon’s website.

8. **Reset Network Settings on Printer**  

   From the printer’s control panel, go to network settings and choose “Reset settings” or “Restore to default.” Then reconfigure WiFi settings.

9. **Disable Firewall Temporarily**  

   On your computer, temporarily disable any firewall or antivirus software that might be preventing the printer from connecting to the network.

10. **Assign a Static IP Address**  

    Login to your router’s settings and assign a fixed IP address to your printer. This can help avoid IP conflicts on busy networks.

11. **Use Canon PRINT App**  

    Download and install the Canon PRINT Inkjet/SELPHY app on your smartphone. The app offers guided steps to set up wireless printing easily.
